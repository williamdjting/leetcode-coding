'''
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, 
and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. 
So it is impossible.

If you have a cyclical graph then you cannot fulfill this, 
If G is a DAG, then G has a topological ordering. 
Must have topological ordering (no cycle) to be True.
